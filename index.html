  <h2>What is Homebrew Website Club?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club">Homebrew Website
    Club</a> is a fortnightly meetup of people passionate about or
    interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own
    website.
  </p>
  <p>The format is deliberately loose. After introductions we talk about
    what we're working on and see if we can help each other with projects.
    Whether you're just starting out with your own website or you want to
    discuss the latest IndieWeb technologies you're welcome to join us.
